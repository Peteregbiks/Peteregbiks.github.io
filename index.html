								<h2 class="major">Robot-aided bullet retrieval</h2>
								<h3 class="role"> Role: Robotics Programmer</h3>
								<h3> Project type: School</h3>
								<h3> Duration: March 2024 to April 2024</h3>
								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>Programmed a Meca 500 robot arm to execute a specialized teleoperation task aimed at assisting in bullet removal. 
									The system utilized an electromagnet at the end effector which is activated upon reaching the bullet. The arm was programmed to precisely maneuver to a defined 
									incision point. Once the robot arm reached this point, the speed was significantly reduced, and the arm transitioned 
									from 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) to 6 DOF for enhanced control and accuracy. This project provided valuable insights into 
									robotic programming, precision control, and the importance of safety in medical applications.</p>
								<h3>Role</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Developed and implemented the control algorithms for the Meca 500 robot arm to perform teleoperated task with the aid of a haptic device.</li>
									<li>Programmed the transition of the robot arm from 3 DOF to 6 DOF upon reaching the defined incision point to enhance operational precision.</li>
									<li>Integrated an electromagnet into the robotic arm's end effector for effective bullet retrieval.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Key Challenge</h3>
								<p>I encounted issues with maintaining precision during the bullet removal operation as it is critical due to the sensitivity of the procedure.</p>
								<h3>Solution</h3>
								<p>I established a reduced workspace for the robot arm in relation to the haptic device's workspace upon reaching the incision point. This adjustment 
									ensured high precision in the arm's movements by implementing a speed reduction protocol, effectively minimizing the risk of error.</p>
								<h3>Tools and Softwares Used</h3>
								<p>Meca500 Robot arm, Haply Inverse3 Haptic device, electromagnet, and Matlab.</p>

								<h3 class="role"> Role: Web Designer</h3>
								<h3> Project type: Personal</h3>
								<h3> Duration: October 2024</h3>
								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>Designed and developed a personal resume website to showcase work experience, projects, education, and an “About Me” section, implementing a 
									clean, interactive, and responsive user interface. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in web development using HTML, JavaScript, 
									jQuery, and CSS, learning about effective web layout, animations, and styling to create an engaging user experience.</p>
								<h3>Role</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Developed structured layouts for sections such as Work Experience, Projects, Education, and About Me using HTML and CSS.</li>
									<li>Created interactive elements with JavaScript and jQuery, enhancing user engagement through animations and smooth navigation.</li>
									<li>Ensured responsive design for compatibility with mobile and desktop devices.</li>
									<li>Integrated smooth scrolling and navigation features for a polished user interface.</li>
									<li>Designed the overall UI to highlight key information effectively, focusing on ease of reading and visual appeal.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Key Challenge</h3>
								<p>The webpage needed to be accessible and visually appealing across all devices.</p>
								<h3>Solution</h3>
								<p>Implemented responsive design using CSS media queries to ensure consistent layout and functionality on different screen sizes.</p>
